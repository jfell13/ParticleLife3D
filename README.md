# ParticleLife3D

A simple 3D particle life simulator using JavaScript and Three.js. 

Particles interact with randomized forces, bounce off walls, and are rendered in a dynamic 3D space with full camera and GUI controls.

## Current Version
**v1.1.0** â€” [View all releases](https://github.com/jfell13/ParticleLife3D/releases)

### Live Demo:
