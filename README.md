# ParticleLife3D

A simple 3D particle life simulator using JavaScript and Three.js. 

Currently particles interact with randomized forces, bounce off walls, and are rendered in a dynamic 3D space with camera controls.

## Current Version
**v1.0.0** â€” [View all releases](https://github.com/jfell13/ParticleLife3D/releases)

### Live Demo:
